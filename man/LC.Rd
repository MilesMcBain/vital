\item{formula}{Model specification.}

\item{adjust}{method to use for adjustment of coefficients \eqn{k_t kt}.
Possibilities are
\dQuote{dt} (Lee-Carter method, the default),
\dQuote{dxt} (BMS method),
\dQuote{e0} (Lee-Miller method based on life expectancy) and
\dQuote{none}.}

\value{
A model specification.

\description{
Lee-Carter model of mortality or fertility rates.
\code{LC()} returns a Lee-Carter model applied to the formula's response
variable as a function of age. This produces a standard Lee-Carter model by
default, although many other options are available. Missing rates are set to
the geometric mean rate for the relevant age.
